This version was developed on Windows using VisualBasic 6 as a FOSS project to allow 
easier configuration, bug-fixing and enhancement of Rocketdock and currently underway,
a fully open source version of a Rocketdock clone.

The first steps are the two VB6 utilities that replicate the icons settings and dock settings 
screen. The subsequent step is the dock itself. I do hope you enjoy using these utilities. 
Your software enhancements and contributions will be gratefully received.

The original Rocketdock was developed by the Apple fanboy and fangirl team at Punklabs. 
They developed it as a peace offering from the Mac community to the Windows 
Community. This new dock, now known as SteamyDock, was developed by a 
Windows/ReactOS fanboy on Windows 7 using 32bit VB6. 

This utility faithfully reproduces the original as created by Punklabs. Initially 
created solely as a homage to Rocketdock as that version is no longer being supported. 
However, it has now evolved into a set of tools that has become a replacement for 
rocketdock itself. It must be stated that the initial idea for this dock came from 
Punklabs but in turn from OS/X dock and its predecessors. 

All HAIL to Apple and Punklabs!

This version was developed on Windows using VisualBasic 6 as a FOSS project. It is open 
source to allow easier configuration, bug-fixing and enhancement of Rocketdock and 
community contribution towards this new dock. The first steps were the two VB6 utilities 
that replicate the icons settings and dock settings screen (this utility). These are 
largely complete and the dock itself is now under development and 90% complete. A future 
step is conversion to 64bit-ness using RADBasic/TwinBasic. Some conversion to VB.NET 
has already been undertaken for future-proofing and 64bit-ness. This latter step is 
1/3rd underway but I may halt and transfer developement to RADBasic in the near future. 

I do hope you enjoy using these utilities. Your software enhancements and contributions 
will be gratefully received if you choose to contribute.

This utility MUST run as administrator when used to access Rocketdock's registry 
settings (due to a Windows shadow registry feature/bug that gives incorrect shadow 
data). Administrator is only required when run with Rocketdock but not when used in 
conjunction with SteamyDock.

Basically, the result is this - If you run it without admin rights and you want to 
change the Rocketdock values in the registry then some of the values may be incorrectly
modified and the resulting dock might look and act rather strange. You have been warned!
