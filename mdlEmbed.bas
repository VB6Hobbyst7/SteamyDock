'[1] Although Microsoft's technical documentation states that this value must be zero, the icon encoder built into .NET
'    (System.Drawing.Icon.Save) sets this value to 255. It appears that the operating system ignores this value altogether.
'[2] Setting the colour planes to 0 or 1 is treated equivalently by the operating system, but if the colour planes are
'    set higher than 1, this value should be multiplied by the bits per pixel to determine the final colour depth of the image.
'    It is unknown if the various Windows operating system versions are resilient to different colour plane values.
'[3] The bits per pixel might be set to zero, but can be inferred from the other data; specifically, if the bitmap is
'    not PNG compressed, then the bits per pixel can be calculated based on the length of the bitmap data relative to the
'    size of the image. If the bitmap is PNG compressed, the bits per pixel are stored within the PNG data. It is unknown if the various Windows operating system versions contain logic to infer the bit depth for all possibilities if this value is set to zero.
